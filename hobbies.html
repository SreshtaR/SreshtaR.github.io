				<h1>Chess</h1>
				<p><br>A board-game where two people go head to head, use their brain, come up with strategies and get a taste of war - <a href="https://www.chess.com/">Chess!</a></p>
				<img src="https://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/chessboard_realistic_vector_illustration_in_black_and_white_6823339.jpg" width=80% height=auto alt="Chess">
				<p><br>What's not to like about this? Picking others' brain and getting to flash my wit, I've been a fan of this game since my abc's.
				Be it playing at home with my cousin, or a tournament full of players (I've won a few), it never fails to make me feel proud of myself and learn new techniques.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm">
				<h1>DIY</h1>
				<p><br>Turning what others would call trash into treasure (and sometimes, well, just destroying something in an attempt to make something else)</p>
				<img src="https://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/crafts_icons_design_elements_silhouette_style_6826873.jpg" width=80% height=auto alt="DIY">
				<p><br>Anyone who has known me since childhood would have a huge collection of "gifts" that I create(d) just for them.
				The journey started in "cute" birthday cards with spelling mistakes and is currently at fixing broken coffee mugs and <br>re-inventing stuff that I lay my eyes upon.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm">
				<h1>Music</h1>
				<p><br>There is sound, there is noise and then there is music. My definition of music - any noise/sound that doesn't get on my nerves.</p>
				<img src="https://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/music_instruments_pattern_colorful_classical_design_6839887.jpg" width=80% height=auto alt="Music">
				<p><br>This one is quite simple - my mom was playing some music and one fine day, the younger me (3 years old) sang along;
				She saw (or heard?) the "genius" in me and I started attending vocal classes. A fan of the R&B and EDM (yes, you read that right), music has been my friend ever since.</p>
